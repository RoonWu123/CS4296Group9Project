# CS4296GrpProject

This is the source code for Convolutional neural networks in CS4296 Group 9 Project. Both tested and worked on AWS Sagemaker and Google Colab Environment. <br>
<br>
The Github Link: <br>
https://github.com/RoonWu123/CS4296Group9Project
<br>
The dataset and the source codes （both Google Colab and Sagemaker） can be found on the following link: <br>

<br>
# Instruction on the AWS SageMaker
<br>

Download the dataset "CatRabbit.zip"<br>
<br>
Then launch a Amazon SageMaker Notebook, select a kernel with TensorFlow module<br>
Due to the limitation of SageMaker notebook cannot upload directories, the directories need to be made manually.<br>
<br>
Create a directory named "CatRabbit" manually (or change the source directories at your convenience)<br>
Then create 3 directories named "test-images", "train-cat-rabbit" and "val-cat-rabbit" manually<br>
For train-cat-rabbit and val-cat-rabbit, create 2 directories named "cat" and "rabbit" manually<br>
<br>
The overall structure will be like: <br>
root/<br>
├─ CatRabbit<br>
│&nbsp;&nbsp;├─ test-images<br>
│&nbsp;&nbsp;├─ train-cat-rabbit<br>
│  │     ├─ cat<br>
│  │     └─ rabbit<br>
│  └─ val-cat-rabbit<br>
│        ├─ cat<br>
│        └─ rabbit<br>
└─ CatRabbitCode.ipynb<br>
<br>
Then unzip the file on you own local machine and upload the content (images) to directories respectively<br>

# Instruction on the Google Colab
<br>
Please head to the https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14LKnmDwWf1rxjUwgH--nPMgwAXOBhadR?usp=sharing
<br>
Download the dataset "CatRabbit.zip" and unzip the content in the zip file and upload it to google drive<br>
<br>
Then launch a Google Colab Notebook (default with TensorFlow module)<br>
<br>
Mount the google drive after enter the Colab environment<br>
