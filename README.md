# CS4296GrpProject

This is the source code for Convolutional neural networks in CS4296 Group 9 Project. Both tested and worked on Amazon Sagemaker and Google Colab Environment. <br>
<br>
The Github Link: <br>
https://github.com/RoonWu123/CS4296Group9Project

<br>
The dataset and the source codes （both Google Colab and Sagemaker） can be found on the following link: <br>

# Software/hardware dependencies

For both source code, there is no special hardware dependencies as both platforms in free tier will prepare the <b><ins>basic</ins></b> hardware. <br>
However, our project has invoked different instances (AWS) and plans (Colab) to review the performance of two different platforms, <br> so the paid tier will have different hardware supplied. <br>

For software dependencies, we need to invoke the kernel with TensorFlow module. Each Colab notebook that Google provided will contain the TensorFlow module by default.<br>
However, for Sagemaker Notebook, it is required to select the kernel manually in the kernel Selection Page after launching the notebook instance.<br>

# Environment Set up on the AWS SageMaker
<br>
Please head to the https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14LKnmDwWf1rxjUwgH--nPMgwAXOBhadR?usp=sharing
<br>Download the dataset "CatRabbit.zip"<br>
Then launch a Amazon SageMaker Notebook, select a kernel with TensorFlow module<br>
Due to the limitation of SageMaker notebook cannot upload directories, the directories need to be made manually.<br>
<br>
Create a directory named "CatRabbit" manually (or change the source directories at your convenience)<br>
Then create 3 directories named "test-images", "train-cat-rabbit" and "val-cat-rabbit" manually<br>
For train-cat-rabbit and val-cat-rabbit, create 2 directories named "cat" and "rabbit" manually<br>
<br>
The overall structure will be like: <br>
root/<br>
├─ CatRabbit<br>
│&nbsp;&nbsp;├─&nbsp;test-images<br>
│&nbsp;&nbsp;├─&nbsp;train-cat-rabbit<br>
│&nbsp;&nbsp;│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├─&nbsp;cat<br>
│&nbsp;&nbsp;│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└─&nbsp;rabbit<br>
│&nbsp;&nbsp;└─&nbsp;val-cat-rabbit<br>
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├─&nbsp;cat<br>
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└─&nbsp;rabbit<br>
└─&nbsp;CatRabbitCode.ipynb<br>
<br>
Then unzip the file on you own local machine and upload the content (images) to directories respectively<br>
The notebook, containing the source code, can now be uploadede to the sagemaker<br>
The data source path may change due to the modification of directories locations<br>

After the set up, the environment should be looked like this:<br>

Both the train-cat-rabbit and val-cat-rabbit directories will contain the following sub-directories. The sub-directories will contain the images<br>

# Environmrnt Set up on the Google Colab
<br>
Please head to the https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14LKnmDwWf1rxjUwgH--nPMgwAXOBhadR?usp=sharing
<br>
Download the dataset "CatRabbit.zip" and unzip the content in the zip file and upload it to google drive<br>
<br>
Then launch a Google Colab Notebook (default with TensorFlow module)<br>
<br>
Mount the google drive after enter the Colab environment<br>

<br>
Verify the data Source is usable on the Google Drive.<br>
Change the path according to your google drive setting. <br>
The dataset need to be downloaded and mounted from google drive first <br>
After mounting, the dataset file should be something like: <br> "/content/drive/(the path of dataset on your google drive path)"<br>

# Parameters of notebook in both platforms
<br>
Both source code contain the same logic. The only differences betwee those source code are the part of data importing. <br>
The functionality of the parameters are also attached to the source code markdown, so as the common possible options of parameters setting.<br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79595031/164979930-e95b020a-6c91-4ccd-8ccc-3f0a3b338bfc.png)

The parameters can be modified in real time before running the code. Therefore, there will not be any parameter explanation in this readme. Please refer to the source code itself.<br>

<br>
<br>

# Results and Evaluation
<br>
In the end of each test tun, the statistic of each experiment will be printed out in the following format. The duration for training each epoch, the loss (the residual between the actual value and the estimated value), the training set accuracy, the validation loss and the validation accuracy will be printed out.
The following is the example output:<br>

The last line will also show the total time required for training the CNN model

<br>
<br>

# Prediction
<br>
Although we have prepared the dataset for testing, you are free to upload any rabbit or cat image to test out the code too.<br>
The model will read the images (only in jpg format) in the "test-images" directory and predict the animal inside the image.<br>
As this part simulate the real world situation, we will not provide any label to the image itself so there will only be one statistic as reference here, unlike previour section for Prediction.<br>
The only statistic involved here is the time required to predict.<br>
This is an example output: <br>
